## The Placemark App
The Placemark app allows users to be able to store different places that they have visited or might wish to visit.
They also have the ability to be able to sort these different placemarks into different category types that they wish
, like for example beaches, mountains, etc.

With their placemarks, a user will be able to store the Name, Description, Latitude and Longitude of the place that 
they have visited. Once the user inputs a valid latitude and longitude, then they will then also be able to see those
coordindates rendered on a map, through the use of Leaflet.

## Built Using
The Placemark app is built by using a node js backend, specifically Hapi.js. The frontend is then built using the 
Handlebars framework, along with Bulma for CSS.
